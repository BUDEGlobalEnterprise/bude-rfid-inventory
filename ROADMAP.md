---

## Phase 4 — RFID Hardware Integration 🔲

Activate real vendor SDKs behind the existing HAL interfaces. Each vendor is an independent, self-contained task.

| Vendor | Adapter | Devices | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Chainway** | `ChainwayBarcodeAdapter` + `ChainwayRfidAdapter` | C72, C66, R6 | 🟡 SDK bridge built; physical validation pending |
| **Zebra** | `ZebraBarcodeAdapter` + `ZebraRfidAdapter` | TC-series + RFD40 / RFID8500 sled | 🔲 |
| **Urovo** | `UrovoBarcodeAdapter` + `UrovoRfidAdapter` | DT40 RFID, i9000s | 🔲 |
| **Honeywell** | `HoneywellBarcodeAdapter` | CT40, EDA52, EDA61k | 🔲 |
| **Generic UHF** | `GenericUhfRfidAdapter` | BLE / USB / LLRP readers | 🔲 |
| **Demo RFID** | `DemoRfidAdapter` | No-reader development / demo mode | ✅ |

**Deliverables per vendor**
- Replace stub `throw VendorSdkUnavailableException()` bodies with real SDK calls
- Add `DeviceProbe` detection (model string, package query, or method-channel ping)
- Integration test harness against device emulator or physical unit
- Update `documentation/hardware-roadmap/integration-roadmap.md`

**Chainway integration notes**
- Cached public Chainway SDK archives under `vendor_sdk_cache/chainway/`.
- Bundled `DeviceAPI_ver20251103_release.aar` into `mobile-app/flutter_app/android/app/libs/`.
- Added Android method/event channels for Chainway barcode and UHF RFID.
- Replaced Chainway Dart stubs with real HAL adapters.
- Still requires validation on a C72/C66/R6 unit before marking complete; this is blocked until reader hardware is available.
- Added no-reader `DemoRfidAdapter` so EPC lookup and future inventory flows can be tested without physical RFID hardware.

## Phase 5 — Analytics & Reporting ✅

KPI dashboards, variance analysis, and data export.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Stock aging report** | Items idle for N days per warehouse; threshold picker (7/14/30/60/90 d); sorted by days idle | ✅ |
| **Variance dashboard** | Submitted reconciliation history — counted vs expected per line, colour-coded surplus/deficit, expandable cards | ✅ |
| **Transfer throughput** | Ops per day from local Hive queue; stacked `fl_chart` bar chart; 7/14/30-day period picker | ✅ |
| **Export to CSV** | Warehouse stock or item ledger as `.csv` via system share sheet (`share_plus`) | ✅ |
| **Pull-to-refresh** | `RefreshIndicator` on warehouse list, warehouse detail, and item history tab | ✅ |

**Backend** — `analytics.get_stock_aging`, `analytics.get_reconciliation_history` (standard ERPNext DocTypes, 9 pytest tests)

**New packages** — `fl_chart ^0.69.0`, `share_plus ^10.0.0`, `csv ^6.0.0`, `path_provider ^2.1.4`

---

## Phase 6 — Role-Based Access & Multi-Entity ✅

Enterprise controls for multi-site, multi-company deployments.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Role-scoped screens** | Hide or disable screens based on ERPNext user roles (`Stock Manager`, `Stock User`) | 🔲 |
| **Per-user default warehouse** | Pull `default_warehouse` from ERPNext User doc, pre-fill dropdowns | 🔲 |
| **Multi-company switcher** | Select active company from a list; scope all operations to that company | 🔲 |
| **Supervisor approval flow** | Large-variance reconciliations require a second user to approve before queuing | 🔲 |
| **Audit trail screen** | List all submitted ops by this device, with ERPNext doc link | 🔲 |
| **Biometric auto-login** | Face ID / fingerprint re-auth after auto-logout timer fires | 🔲 |

---

## Phase 7 — Additional ERP Connectors 💡

`erpnext_client.py` is the first `ErpClient` implementation. Each new connector lives alongside it and conforms to the same interface; the mobile app is unaware.

| Connector | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ERPNext / Frappe | ✅ Shipped |
| Zoho Inventory | 💡 |
| SAP Business One (Service Layer) | 💡 |
| NetSuite (SuiteQL REST) | 💡 |

## Phase 8 — Power-User Experience 💡

Quality-of-life features for high-throughput warehouse operators.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Command palette** | Keyboard / search shortcut (`⌘K` or swipe) to jump to any screen or barcode | 💡 |
| **Drag-and-drop dashboard** | Operator can re-order, pin, or hide nav cards | 💡 |
| **Print labels** | Generate ZPL / PDF label for a scanned item or bin | 💡 |
| **Batch RFID inventory** | Continuous UHF tag reads → auto-populate reconciliation list | 💡 |
| **Push notifications** | Server-side webhook → FCM/APNs for low-stock alerts or PO arrivals | 💡 |
| **Plugin marketplace** | Third-party bude_api modules discoverable and installable from the app | 💡 |

---

## Phase 9 - End-to-End Product Hardening IN PROGRESS

Goal: make the app production-ready as a complete warehouse operator workflow, not just a set of working screens. This phase is about stability, security, usability, visual consistency, and field confidence across ERPNext, offline sync, and hardware.

### Golden Business Flows

Every release candidate must pass these flows on a clean install and on an existing logged-in install:

| Flow | Happy path | Failure/offline path | Status |
|------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Tenant + login** | Configure ERPNext URL, verify health, login, restore session after restart | Invalid URL, bad credentials, expired session, tenant reset | PLANNED |
| **Dashboard command center** | Dashboard loads KPIs, alerts, quick actions, sync status, role-aware nav | Offline dashboard uses cached counts and clear empty/error states | PLANNED |
| **Item lookup** | Search item, scan barcode, read RFID EPC, open item/asset detail | Scanner unavailable, unknown EPC/barcode, network failure | IN PROGRESS |
| **Stock transfer** | Scan multiple items, edit qty, choose warehouses, queue transfer, sync to ERPNext | Offline queue, failed sync retry, duplicate barcode handling | PLANNED |
| **Goods receipt** | Receive free items or against PO, validate warehouse/PO lines, queue and sync | PO mismatch, unknown item, failed submission retry | PLANNED |
| **Stock reconciliation** | Batch scan/count, compare expected qty, supervisor approval when needed | Large variance approval, failed retry, offline count preservation | PLANNED |
| **Asset operations** | Find asset, move asset, create repair, view maintenance state | Unknown asset, failed queue op, offline repair/movement draft | PLANNED |
| **Audit + reporting** | Review submitted/pending/failed ops, export CSV, open ERP references | Missing ERP link, no file permission, empty report states | PLANNED |
| **Hardware** | Camera fallback, Chainway barcode, Chainway UHF read/write/inventory | SDK missing, device unsupported, reader busy, permission failure | IN PROGRESS |

Note: physical RFID validation is blocked until a reader is available. Until then, no-reader demo mode covers lookup and adapter-level tests.

### Stability Workstream

- Add smoke/widget tests for the golden screens: splash, onboarding, login, dashboard, lookup, scan session, transfer, receipt, reconciliation, assets, sync, settings.
- Add route-contract tests for every `GoRoute`, including required `extra` values such as reconciliation approval.
- Add sync queue recovery tests for app restart, duplicate operation IDs, failed operation retry, and pending-approval state.
- Add hardware fake adapters for barcode/RFID so scanner and lookup flows can be tested without physical devices.
- Add backend unit tests for newer assets, alerts, reports, and RFID scan endpoints to match existing stock/items coverage.
- Add one Android build job and one Flutter test/analyze job to CI as release gates.

### Security Workstream

- Enforce HTTPS for production tenant URLs, while allowing localhost/dev hosts only in debug/dev configuration.
- Keep API keys/session material in `FlutterSecureStorage`; audit Hive/SharedPreferences to ensure no credentials or sensitive ERP payloads are stored there.
- Add automatic session expiry handling: intercept 401/403, clear stale auth, redirect to login, and preserve pending offline work.
- Finish role-based access consistently across dashboard cards, shell navigation, direct routes, and backend endpoint permissions.
- Add server-side permission checks for stock, asset, report, and analytics endpoints; mobile UI gating is convenience only.
- Add safe logging rules: no passwords, API secrets, authorization headers, or full ERP payload dumps in logs.

### UX And Visual Workstream

- Replace remaining hardcoded user-visible strings with ARB keys in English and Arabic.
- Standardize loading, empty, error, and retry states using shared components.
- Polish high-throughput scanner screens for gloves/warehouse use: large tap targets, strong contrast, clear reader status, audible/haptic feedback settings.
- Align dashboard cards, KPI cards, forms, and list rows to one visual density system; keep operational screens quiet and scannable.
- Add responsive screenshots or golden checks for phone, tablet, and desktop-width Flutter layouts.
- Verify RTL layout on Arabic for dashboard, settings, forms, scanner, and reports.

### Hardware Workstream

- Complete physical validation checklist for Chainway C72/C66/R6: device probe, barcode scan, UHF single read, continuous inventory, power level, write EPC, lock/kill safeguards.
- Keep Chainway SDK artifacts documented with source URL, version/date, checksum, and install steps.
- Implement Zebra, Urovo, Honeywell, and Generic UHF adapters one vendor at a time, behind existing HAL contracts.
- Add a device lab test script: install APK, run probe, scan known barcode, read known EPC, submit lookup result.
- Add production guardrails for destructive RFID operations: write/lock/kill require explicit confirmation and manager role.

### Release Readiness

- `flutter analyze --no-pub` passes.
- `flutter test --no-pub` passes.
- Android `:app:assembleDebug` passes, and release build/signing steps are documented.
- Backend `pytest` passes for `bude_api`.
- No unresolved high-severity review findings for auth, sync, stock operations, or hardware operations.
- Field pilot checklist completed on at least one real ERPNext site and one real Chainway device.

## Phase 10 - Market-Driven Warehouse Execution PLANNED

Positioning: sell this as an **ERPNext Warehouse Execution Mobile Pack**, not only an RFID app. The paid value is faster warehouse work, fewer stock mistakes, stronger controls, and mobile execution that can later become RFID-assisted.

| Priority | Capability | Customer value | Status |
|----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Bin / rack / shelf / staging location execution** | Operators can receive, count, move, and stage stock at the real physical location level while still using standard ERPNext warehouse structures | DONE |
| 2 | **Picking, packing, and dispatch from Sales Orders** | Turns Sales Orders into guided mobile fulfillment work with fewer missed or wrong shipments | DONE |
| 3 | **Batch, serial, lot, and expiry support** | Supports regulated, perishable, warranty, and high-value inventory workflows that customers expect to pay for | DONE |
| 4 | **Label printing for items, bins, pallets, and receipts** | Makes mobile execution tangible on the floor through barcode/RFID-ready labels and receiving documents | PLANNED |
| 5 | **Approval and audit controls** | Gives managers confidence around variance, high-value movement, and compliance-sensitive changes | PLANNED |
| 6 | **Backend permission hardening** | Ensures mobile convenience never bypasses ERPNext roles, companies, warehouses, or document permissions | PLANNED |
| 7 | **Guided warehouse task queue** | Converts open ERP work into assigned, prioritized mobile tasks for operators and supervisors | PLANNED |
| 8 | **Exception handling workflows** | Captures shortages, damages, unknown scans, substitutions, and blocked stock without leaving the floor | PLANNED |
| 9 | **ROI / value dashboard** | Shows management measurable gains: faster receiving, fewer adjustments, pick accuracy, and inventory variance reduction | PLANNED |
| 10 | **Admin onboarding console** | Helps customers configure companies, warehouses, default roles, devices, and pilot workflows without developer help | PLANNED |

Execution rule: implement these one by one. Start with optional bin/location execution using standard ERPNext warehouse/bin concepts; do not add custom DocTypes unless standard ERPNext cannot represent the workflow.

Bin / rack / shelf / staging execution is implemented by treating physical locations as standard ERPNext child `Warehouse` records. Mobile operators select a parent warehouse, optionally choose one child location, and queued transfer, receipt, and reconciliation operations submit that child Warehouse as the effective stock location.

Sales Order fulfillment is implemented as a mobile Pick → Pack → Dispatch flow. Operators choose an open Sales Order, scan or enter exact pending quantities for every line, confirm packing, and queue a standard ERPNext `Delivery Note` linked to the original Sales Order lines.

Batch, serial, lot, and expiry support is implemented with standard ERPNext `Batch` and `Serial No` records. "Lot" maps to ERPNext `Batch`; mobile stock flows store tracking allocations in queued payloads, and receipts can create standard batches with expiry before the stock document is submitted.

---

## Architecture Constraints

- **No custom DocTypes** — every read/write uses standard ERPNext DocTypes (`Stock Entry`, `Purchase Receipt`, `Stock Reconciliation`, `Sales Order`, `Delivery Note`, `Bin`, `Stock Ledger Entry`).
- **HAL isolation** — all hardware-specific code lives in `lib/core/hardware/vendors/`. Business code only imports from `lib/core/hardware/adapters/`.
- **Offline-first** — every user-initiated operation is queued locally first; network is opportunistic.
- **Clean architecture** — each feature has independent `domain / data / presentation` layers; cross-feature dependencies flow only through providers.
- **i18n from day one** — all user-visible strings are ARB keys; new screens must add EN + AR entries before merge.

---

## Contributing

See `documentation/architecture/development-guidelines.md` for branch conventions, commit format, and test requirements. All new backend endpoints need pytest coverage; all new mobile screens need `flutter analyze` to be clean before merge.
